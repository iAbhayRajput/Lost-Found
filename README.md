# Lost-Found
By addressing these inefficiencies through technology and a well-designed system like the Lost and Found Desk, our solution aims to streamline the process and enhance accessibility
To access the main site open tile.html
It opens up a fully functional SRM university site
in which we added the section of Lost & Found naming 'L&F' which is located in the nav bar 
after reaching the lost and found the page you'll get 2 options to find and report 
for reporting you have to give item name, category and description which only the one who reports can use 
find can be used by entering name of that item, it's category, and the time when it got lost 
then you'll be directed to an authentication page where you can provide info about lost items
